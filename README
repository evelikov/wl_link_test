What/why/who

This is a simple binary/library combo to demonstrate the following, wrt the
introduction of wayland-util:
 - The util library is implicitly pulled (NEEDED in the final binary)
 - Explicitly using the util API libraries while linking against client/server
does not produce any warnings.
 - Other ?

The following flags were used to prod the linker to produce extra warnings.
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-O1,--sort-common,--as-needed,-z,relro"
